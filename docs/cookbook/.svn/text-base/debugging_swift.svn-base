Debugging Swift
---------------
Swift errors are logged in several places:

. All text from standard output and standard error produced by running the
swift command
. The .log file from this run. It will be named swiftscript.uniqueID.log
where "swiftscript" is the name of your *.swift script source file, and
uniqueID is a long unique id which starts with the date and time you ran the
swift command.
. $HOME/.globus/coasters directory on remote machines on which you are
running coasters
. $HOME/.globus/scripts directory on the host on which you run the Swift
command, when swift is submitting to a local scheduler (Condor, PBS, SGE,
Cobalt)
. $HOME/.globus/??? on remote systems that you access via Globus
