Swift Basics
------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section takes you through the installation of the Swift system on your
computer. We will start with the prerequisites as explained in the subsequent
section.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.Check your Java
Swift is a Java application. Make sure you are running Java version 5 or higher. You
can make sure you have Java in your $PATH (or $HOME/.soft file depending upon
your environment) 

Following are the possible ways to detect and run Java:

----
$ grep java $HOME/.soft
#+java-sun # Gives you Java 5
+java-1.6.0_03-sun-r1
$ which java
/soft/java-1.6.0_11-sun-r1/bin/java
$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_11"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_11-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0-b16, mixed mode)
----

Setting up to run Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is simple. We will be using a pre-compiled version of Swift that can be
downloaded from link:http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/downloads/index.php[here]. Download and untar the latest precompiled version as follows:

----
$ tar xf swift-0.92.1.tar.gz
----

Environment Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The examples were tested with Java version 1.6. Make sure you do not already
have Swift in your PATH. If you do, remove it, or remove any +swift or @swift
lines from your $HOME/.soft or $HOME/.bash_profile file. Then do:

----
PATH=$PATH:/path/to/swift/bin
----

Note that the environment will be different when using Swift from prebuilt distribution (as above) and trunk. The PATH setup when using swift from trunk would be as follows:

----
PATH=$PATH:/path/to/swift/dist/swift-svn/bin
----

WARNING: Do NOT set SWIFT_HOME or CLASSPATH in your environment unless you
fully understand how these will affect Swift's execution.

To execute your Swift script on a login host (or "localhost") use
the following command: 

----
swift -tc.file tc somescript.swift
----

Setting transformation catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The transformation catalog lists where application executables are located on
remote sites.

By default, the site catalog is stored in etc/tc.data. This path can be
overridden with the tc.file configuration property, either in the Swift
configuration file or on the command line.

The format is one line per executable per site, with fields separated by tabs
or spaces.

Some example entries: 

----
localhost  echo    /bin/echo       INSTALLED       INTEL32::LINUX  null
TGUC       touch   /usr/bin/touch  INSTALLED       INTEL32::LINUX GLOBUS::maxwalltime="00:00:10"
----
The fields are: _site_, _transformation-name_, _executable-path_, _installation-status_, _platform_, and _profile_ entries.

The _site_ field should correspond to a site name listed in the sites catalog.

The _transformation-name_ should correspond to the transformation name used in a
SwiftScript app procedure.

The _executable-path_ should specify where the particular executable is located
on that site.

The _installation-status_ and _platform_ fields are not used. Set them to
**INSTALLED** and **INTEL32::LINUX** respectively.

The _profiles_ field should be set to null if no profile entries are to be
specified, or should contain the profile entries separated by semicolons. 

Setting swift configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Many configuration properties could be set using the Swift configuration file.
We will not cover them all in this section. see
link:http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/userguide.php#engineconfiguration[here] for details. In this section we will cover a simple configuration file with the most basic properties.

----

clustering.queue.delay=10
clustering.min.time=86400
foreach.max.threads=100
provenance.log=true
----

Setting sites.xml
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
sites.xml specifies details of the sites that Swift can run on. Following is
an example of a simple sites.xml file entry for running Swift on local
environment:

[xml]
source~~~~~~
<pool handle="localhost">
<filesystem provider="local" />
<execution provider="local" />
<workdirectory >/var/tmp</workdirectory>
<profile namespace="karajan" key="jobThrottle">.07</profile>
<profile namespace="karajan"
key="initialScore">100000</profile>
</pool>
source~~~~~~

First SwiftScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your first SwiftScript
Hello Swift-World!

A good sanity check that Swift is set up and running OK locally is this:

----
$ which swift

/home/wilde/swift/src/stable/cog/modules/swift/dist/swift-svn/bin/swift

$ echo 'trace("Hello, Swift world!");' >hello.swift

$ swift hello.swift

Swift svn swift-r3202 cog-r2682

RunID: 20100115-1240-6xhzxuz3

Progress:

A good first tutorial in using Swift is at:
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/tutorial.php. Follow the steps in that
tutorial to learn how to run a few simple scripts on the login host.

second SwiftScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following is a more involved Swift script.
[java]
source~~~~~~~
type file;

app (file o) cat (file i)
{
    cat @i stdout=@o;   
}

file out[]<simple_mapper; location="outdir", prefix="f.",suffix=".out">; 

foreach j in [1:@toint(@arg("n","1"))] {    

    file data<"data.txt">;  

    out[j] = cat(data);    
}
source~~~~~~~

Swift Commandline Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A description of Swift Commandline Options

Also includes a description of Swift inputs and outputs.

What if Swift hangs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Owing to its highly multithreaded architecture it is often the case that the
underlying java virtual machine gets into deadlock situations or Swift hangs
because of other complications in its threaded operations. Under such
situations, Swift _hang-checker_ chips in and resolves the situation.

. how to use the information to identify and correct the deadlock.

. How close to the Swift source code can we make the hang-checker messages, so that the user can relate it to Swift functions, expressions, and ideally source code lines?

. The current Hang Checker output is actually *very* nice and useful already:

SgtDim sub - Open, 1 listeners

Variation[] vars  Closed, 72 elements, 0 listeners
----

Resuming a stopped or crashed Swift Run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I had a .rlog file from a Swift run that ran out of time. I kicked it off
using the -resume flag described in section 16.2 of the Swift User Guide and
it picked up where it left off. Then I killed it because I wanted to make
changes to my sites file.

From Neil: A comment about that section of the user guide: It says "In order
to restart from a restart log file, the -resume logfile argument can be used
after the SwiftScript? program file name." and then puts the -resume logfile
argument before the script file name. I'm sure the order doesn't matter but
the contradiction is confusing.

Notes to add (from Mike):

- explain what aspects of a Swift script make it restartable, and which
  aspects are notrestartable. Eg, if your mappers can return different data at
different times, what happens? What other non-determinsitc behavior would
cause unpredictable, unexpected, or undesired behavior on resumption?

- explain what changes you can make in the execution environment (eg
  increasing or reducing CPUs to run on or throttles, etc); fixing tc.data
entries, env vars, or apps, etc.

- note that resume will again retry failed app() calls. Explain if the retry
  count starts over or not.

- explain how to resume after multiple failures and resumes - i.e. if a .rlog
  is generated on each run, which one should you resume from? Do you have a
choice of resuming from any of them, and what happens if you go backwards to
an older resume file?

- whap happens when you kill (eg with ^C) a running swift script? Is the
  signal caught, and the resume file written out at that point? Or written out
all along? (Note case in which script ws running for hours, then hit ^C, but
resume fie was short (54 bbytes) and swift shows no sign of doing a resume?
(It silently ignored resume file instead of acknowleging that it found one
with not useful resume state in it???) Swift should clearly state that its
resuming and what its resume state is. 

+swift -resume ftdock-[id].0.rlog \[rest of the exact command line from initial
run\]+


Passing an array to swift?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Arrays can be passed to Swift in one of the following ways:

. You can write the array to a file and read in in swift using
readData (or readData2).
. Direct the array into a file (possibly with a "here document" which expands the array) and then read the file in Swift with readData() or process it with a Swift app() function?
. You can use @strsplit on a comma separated command line arg and that works well for me.

Mappers
^^^^^^^^
SimpleMapper

----
$ cat swiftapply.swift
----

[java]
source~~~~
type RFile;
trace("hi 1");
app (RFile result) RunR (RFile rcall)
{
  RunR @rcall @result;
}
trace("hi 2");
RFile rcalls[] ;
RFile results[] ;
trace("start");
foreach c, i in rcalls {
  trace("c",i,@c);
  trace("r",i,@filename(results[i]));
  results[i] = RunR(c);
}
source~~~~

----
$ ls calldir resdir
calldir:
rcall.1.Rdata  rcall.2.Rdata  rcall.3.Rdata  rcall.4.Rdata
resdir:
result.1.Rdata result.2.Rdata result.3.Rdata result.4.Rdata
$ 
----

Notes:

how the .'s match
prefix and suffix dont span dirs
intervening pattern must be digits
these digits become the array indices
explain how padding= arg works & helps (including padding=0)
figure out and explain differences between simple_mapper and
filesys_mapper
FIXME: Use the "filesys_mapper" and its "location=" parameter to map the
input data from /home/wilde/bigdata/* 

Abbreviations for SingleFileMapper
Notes:

within <> you can only have a literal string as in <"filename">, not an
expression. Someday we will fix this to make <> accept a general expression.
you can use @filenames( ) (note: plural) to pull off a list of filenames. 

writeData()

example here 

----
$ cat writedata.swift
----

[java]
source~~~~
type file;

file f <"filea">;
file nf <"filenames">;
nf = writeData(@f);
source~~~~

StructuredRegexpMapper
IN PROGRESS This mapper can be used to base the mapped filenames of an output
array on the mapped filenames of an existing array. landuse outputfiles[]
<structured_regexp_mapper; source=inputfiles,
location="./output",match="(.)*tif", transform="\\1histogram">;

Use the undocumented "structured_regexp_mapper" to name the output
filenames based on the input filenames: 

For example:

----
login2$ ls /home/wilde/bigdata/data/sample
h11v04.histogram  h11v05.histogram  h12v04.histogram  h32v08.histogram
h11v04.tif        h11v05.tif        h12v04.tif        h32v08.tif
login2$

login2$ cat regexp2.swift
type tif;
type mytype;

tif  images[]<filesys_mapper; 
location="/home/wilde/bigdata/data/sample", prefix="h", suffix=".tif">;

mytype of[] <structured_regexp_mapper; source=images, match="(h..v..)", 
transform="output/myfile.\\1.mytype">;

foreach image, i in images {
   trace(i,@filename(images));
   trace(i,@filename(of[i]));
}
