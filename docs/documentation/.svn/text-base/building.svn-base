Building Documentation Manually
-------------------------------
Before committing anything to SVN, it is a good idea manually
build the documentation for testing purposes. 

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several prerequisites for building documentation:

* asciidoc and a2x (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc)
* dblatex (http://dblatex.sourceforge.net)
* source-highlight (http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite)

For CI users, compiled versions of these packages can be found in ~davidk.

build_docs.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script to build the documentation is docs/build_docs.sh. This script 
will convert the documents into HTML and PDF, and then copy the
files to a given output directory.

.Usage
-----
./build_docs.sh /path/to/copy/output
