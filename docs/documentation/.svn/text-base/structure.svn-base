Structure
---------
A specific file and directory structure is required for each document in order to ease the
process of automation, conversion, and copying.

Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~
Each subdirectory within docs/ should correspond to the name of the document.
This name will also later be used in the URL used to point to the
document.

.Example Directory Names 
-----
docs/userguide
docs/tutorial
-----

AsciiDoc File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every document directory should contain one file with a .txt 
extension. This .txt file is the AsciiDoc document that later gets converted
to various formats.

.Example AsciiDoc Documents
-----
docs/userguide/userguide.txt
docs/tutorial/tutorial.txt
-----

Chapters
~~~~~~~~
Each document directory should contain individual chapters
that make up the document. These chapters should not have any
file extensions. 

.Example Chapters
-----
docs/userguide/overview
docs/userguide/language
docs/userguide/mappers
docs/userguide/commands
-----

Including Chapters in a Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The .txt file should then include the individual chapters 
with the AsciiDoc include command.

.userguide.txt
-----
\include::overview[]

\include::language[]

\include::mappers[]

\include::commands[]
-----

WARNING: Be sure to include spaces between includes. Putting them together with no spaces can cause formatting/compilation errors.
