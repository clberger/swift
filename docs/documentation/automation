Document Automation
-------------------
All .txt files in the docs directory get converted to HTML and PDF on a nightly 
basis. These documents then get copied to the Swift web site.

Cron Job
~~~~~~~~
The job that processes these documents runs on Bridled at 7pm nightly. The script is 
/home/davidk/docscripts/update_and_build.sh. The script calls svn update on several 
different swift directories in ~davidk, and then builds the the documents. The 
documents should be built for each Swift branch later than 0.93, including trunk. As 
new versions of Swift are created, this script will need to be updated.

Website
-------
Once the cron job runs, documents can be accessed at:

\http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-<version>/documentname/documentname.html
\http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-<version>/documentname/documentname.pdf

For example, assume that you create a document called docs/newdoc. You check this 
guide into Swift 0.93. The AsciiDoc .txt file is called newdoc.txt. The URLs
that would be generated would be:

\http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.93/newdoc/newdoc.html
\http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.93/newdoc/newdoc.pdf
