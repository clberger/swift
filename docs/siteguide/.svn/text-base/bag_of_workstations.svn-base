Bag of Workstations
-------------------
"Bag of workstations" refers to a collection of machines that are not connected
together as part of a cluster or supercomputer. 

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to run Swift on a bag of workstations, the following prerequisites must
be met:

- The machines must be running Linux
- The machines must have Perl available
- A user account must be created on each machine (the username you create must be the same on each machine)
- You must be able to SSH into the accounts without being prompted for a password. This usually involves creating an SSH key and setting up your authorized_keys. More information on how to do this can be found at http://www.openssh.org.

Create a coaster-service.conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To begin, copy the text below and paste it into the directory
where your swift script is located. Name this file coaster-service.conf.

-----
include::../../etc/coaster-service.conf[]
-----

Modify coaster-service.conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The coaster-service.conf file contains information about your setup.
There are a few settings you must customize.

The first is the name of the machines which will be used as workers. Modify
the line below to reflect the names of the machines you want to use.
-----
export WORKER_HOSTS="myhost1.mydomain myhost2.mydomain"
-----

Update the value for JOBS_PER_NODE to reflect the number of CPUs available per node.

The JOB_THROTTLE setting determines the maximum number of active jobs. Use the formula
to determine the ideal value:

jobs per node * number of nodes - 0.1 / 100

Example: Suppose you have 10 machines each with 8 cores
-----
8 jobs per node * 10 cores = 80
80 - 0.1 = 79.9
79.9 / 100 = 0.799
-----

In this example, you would set the job throttle to 0.799
-----
export JOB_THROTTLE=0.799
-----

By default, this setup assumes there are no firewall rescrictions. If there
is a firewall rescricting SSH access, set tunneling to true with this command

-----
export SSH_TUNNELING=yes
-----

This setup also assumes that these machines are not using a shared filesystem (NFS/AFS/CIFS, etc). 
If these systems are all sharing a common filesystem, add the setting below.

-----
export SHARED_FILESYSTEM=no
-----

Starting the Coaster Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change directories to the location where you would like to run a 
Swift script and start the coaster service with this
command:

-----
start-coaster-service
-----

This will create a configuration file that Swift needs
called sites.xml.

WARNING: Any existing sites.xml files in this directory
will be overwritten. Be sure to make a copy of any 
custom configuration files you may have.

Run Swift
~~~~~~~~~

Next, run Swift. If you do not have a particular script
in mind, you can test Swift by using a Swift script in
the examples/ directory.

Run the following command to run the script:
-----
swift -sites.file sites.xml -tc.file tc.data yourscript.swift
-----

Stopping the Coaster Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The coaster service will run indefinitely. The stop-coaster-service
script will terminate the coaster service.

-----
$ stop-coaster-service
-----

This will kill the coaster service and kill the worker scripts on remote systems.
