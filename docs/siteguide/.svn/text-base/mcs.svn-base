MCS Workstations
----------------
This sections describes how to use the general use compute servers for 
the MCS division of Argonne National Laboratory.

Create a coaster-service.conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To begin, copy the text below and paste it into your Swift distribution's etc 
directory. Name the file coaster-service.conf.

-----
include::../../tests/providers/mcs/coaster-service.conf[]
-----

Starting the Coaster Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change directories to the location you would like to run a 
Swift script and start the coaster service with this
command:

-----
start-coaster-service
-----

This will create a configuration file that Swift needs
called sites.xml.

WARNING: Any existing sites.xml files in this directory
will be overwritten. Be sure to make a copy of any 
custom configuration files you may have.

Run Swift
~~~~~~~~~

Next, run Swift. If you do not have a particular script
in mind, you can test Swift by using a Swift script in
the examples/ directory.

Run the following command to run the script:
-----
swift -sites.file sites.xml -tc.file tc.data yourscript.swift
-----

Stopping the Coaster Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The coaster service will run indefinitely. The stop-coaster-service
script will terminate the coaster service.

-----
$ stop-coaster-service
-----

This will kill the coaster service and kill the worker scripts on remote systems.
