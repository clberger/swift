Overview
--------
This manual provides reference material for Swift: the SwiftScript
language and the Swift runtime system. For introductory material,
consult the Swift tutorial
<http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/tutorial.php>.

Swift is a data-oriented coarse grained scripting language that supports
dataset typing and mapping, dataset iteration, conditional branching,
and procedural composition.

Swift programs (or workflows) are written in a language called
SwiftScript.

SwiftScript programs are dataflow oriented - they are primarily
concerned with processing (possibly large) collections of data files, by
invoking programs to do that processing. Swift handles execution of such
programs on remote sites by choosing sites, handling the staging of
input and output files to and from the chosen sites and remote execution
of program code.
