Commands
--------
The commands detailed in this section are available in the bin/
directory of a Swift installation and can by run from the commandline if
that directory is placed on the PATH.


swift
~~~~~
The swift command is the main command line tool for executing
SwiftScript programs.


Command-line Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The swift command is invoked as follows: swift [options]
SwiftScript-program [SwiftScript-arguments]* with options taken from the
following list, and SwiftScript-arguments made available to the
SwiftScript program through the @arg function.

Swift command-line options

-help or -h

    Display usage information

-typecheck

    Does a typecheck of a SwiftScript program, instead of executing it.

-dryrun

    Runs the SwiftScript program without submitting any jobs (can be
    used to get a graph)

-monitor

    Shows a graphical resource monitor

-resume file

    Resumes the execution using a log file

-config file

    Indicates the Swift configuration file to be used for this run.
    Properties in this configuration file will override the default
    properties. If individual command line arguments are used for
    properties, they will override the contents of this file.

-verbose | -v

    Increases the level of output that Swift produces on the console to
    include more detail about the execution

-debug | -d

    Increases the level of output that Swift produces on the console to
    include lots of detail about the execution

-logfile file

    Specifies a file where log messages should go to. By default Swift
    uses the name of the program being run and a numeric index (e.g.
    myworkflow.1.log)

-runid identifier

    Specifies the run identifier. This must be unique for every
    invocation and is used in several places to keep files from
    different executions cleanly separated. By default, a datestamp and
    random number are used to generate a run identifier. When using this
    parameter, care should be taken to ensure that the run ID remains
    unique with respect to all other run IDs that might be used,
    irrespective of (at least) expected execution sites, program or user.

-tui

    Displays an interactive text mode monitor during a run. (since Swift
    0.9) 

In addition, the following Swift properties can be set on the command line:

    * caching.algorithm
    * clustering.enabled
    * clustering.min.time
    * clustering.queue.delay
    * ip.address
    * kickstart.always.transfer
    * kickstart.enabled
    * lazy.errors
    * pgraph
    * pgraph.graph.options
    * pgraph.node.options
    * sitedir.keep
    * sites.file
    * tc.file
    * tcp.port.range


Return codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The swift command may exit with the following return codes:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|=========
|value|meaning
|0|success
|1|command line syntax error or missing project name
|2|error during execution
|3|error during compilation
|4|input file does not exist
|===========

Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The swift is influenced by the following environment variables:

GLOBUS_HOSTNAME, GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE - set in the environment
before running Swift. These can be set to inform Swift of the
configuration of your local firewall. More information can be found in
the Globus firewall How-to <http://dev.globus.org/wiki/FirewallHowTo>.

COG_OPTS - set in the environment before running Swift. Options set in
this variable will be passed as parameters to the Java Virtual Machine
which will run Swift. The parameters vary between virtual machine
imlementations, but can usually be used to alter settings such as
maximum heap size. Typing 'java -help' will sometimes give a list of
commands. The Sun Java 1.4.2 command line options are documented here
<http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/windows/java.html>.


swift-osg-ress-site-catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The swift-osg-ress-site-catalog command generates a site catalog based
on OSG <http://www.opensciencegrid.org/>'s ReSS information system
(since Swift 0.9)

Usage: *swift-osg-ress-site-catalog [options]*

--help

    Show help message

--vo=[name]

    Set what VO to query ReSS for

--engage-verified

    Only retrieve sites verified by the Engagement VO site verification
    tests This can not be used together with |--vo|, as the query will
    only work for sites advertising support for the Engagement VO.

    This option means information will be retrieved from the Engagement
    collector instead of the top-level ReSS collector.

--out=[filename]

    Write to [filename] instead of stdout

--condor-g

    Generates sites files which will submit jobs using a local Condor-G
    installation rather than through direct GRAM2 submission. (since
    Swift 0.10)


swift-plot-log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
swift-plot-log generates summaries of Swift run log files.

Usage: swift-plot-log [logfile] [targets]

When no targets are specified, swift-plog-log will generate an HTML
report for the run. When targets are specified, only those named targets
will be generated.
