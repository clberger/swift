How-To Tips for Specific User Communities
-----------------------------------------

Saving Logs - for UChicago CI Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have a UChicago Computation Institute account, run this command
in your submit directory after each run. It will copy all your logs and
kickstart records into a directory at the CI for reporting, usage
tracking, support and debugging.

----
rsync --ignore-existing *.log *.d login.ci.uchicago.edu:/disks/ci-gpfs/swift/swift-logs/ --verbose
----

Specifying TeraGrid allocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TeraGrid users with no default project or with several project
allocations can specify a project allocation using a profile key in the
site catalog entry for a TeraGrid site:

----
<profile namespace="globus" key="project">TG-CCR080002N</profile>
----

More information on the TeraGrid allocations process can be found here
<http://www.teragrid.org/userinfo/access/allocations.php>.

Launching MPI jobs from Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is an example of running a simple MPI program.

In SwiftScript, we make an invocation that does not look any different
from any other invocation. In the below code, we do not have any input
files, and have two output files on stdout and stderr:

----
type file;  
  
(file o, file e) p() {   
    app {  
        mpi stdout=@filename(o) stderr=@filename(e);  
    }  
}  
  
file mpiout <"mpi.out">;  
file mpierr <"mpi.err">;  
  
(mpiout, mpierr) = p();  
----

Now we define how 'mpi' will run in tc.data:
----
tguc    mpi             /home/benc/mpi/mpi.sh   INSTALLED       INTEL32::LINUX GLOBUS::host_xcount=3
----

mpi.sh is a wrapper script that launches the MPI program. It must be
installed on the remote site:

----
#!/bin/bash
mpirun -np 3 -machinefile $PBS_NODEFILE /home/benc/mpi/a.out 
----

Because of the way that Swift runs its server side code,
provider-specific MPI modes (such as GRAM jobType=mpi) should not be
used. Instead, the mpirun command should be explicitly invoked.

Running on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since 10/11/09, the development version of Swift has the ability to run
on a Windows machine, as well as the ability to submit jobs to a Windows
site (provided that an appropriate provider is used).

In order to launch Swift on Windows, use the provided batch file
(swift.bat). In certain cases, when a large number of jar libraries are
present in the Swift lib directory and depending on the exact location
of the Swift installation, the classpath environment variable that the
Swift batch launcher tries to create may be larger than what Windows can
handle. In such a case, either install Swift in a directory closer to
the root of the disk (say, c:\swift) or remove non-essential jar files
from the Swift lib directory.

Due to the large differences between Windows and Unix environments,
Swift must use environment specific tools to achieve some of its goals.
In particular, each Swift executable is launched using a wrapper script.
This script is a Bourne Shell script. On Windows machines, which have no
Bourne Shell interpreter installed by default, the Windows Scripting
Host is used instead, and the wrapper script is written in VBScript.
Similarly, when cleaning up after a run, the "/bin/rm" command available
in typical Unix environments must be replaced by the "del" shell command.

It is important to note that in order to select the proper set of tools
to use, Swift must know when a site runs under Windows. To inform Swift
of this, specify the "sysinfo" attribute for the "pool" element in the
site catalog. For example:

----
<pool handle="localhost" sysinfo="INTEL32::WINDOWS">  
...  
</pool>  
----
