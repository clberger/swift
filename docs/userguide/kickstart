Kickstart
---------
Kickstart is a tool that can be used to gather various information about
the remote execution environment for each job that Swift tries to run.

For each job, Kickstart generates an XML invocation record. By default
this record is staged back to the submit host if the job fails.

Before it can be used it must be installed on the remote site and the
sites file must be configured to point to kickstart.

Kickstart can be downloaded as part of the Pegasus 'worker package'
available from the worker packages section of the Pegasus download page
<http://pegasus.isi.edu/code.php>.

Untar the relevant worker package somewhere where it is visible to all
of the worker nodes on the remote execution machine (such as in a shared
application filesystem).

Now configure the gridlaunch attribute of the sites catalog to point to
that path, by adding a gridlaunch attribute to the pool element in
the site catalog:

----
<pool handle="example" gridlaunch="/usr/local/bin/kickstart" sysinfo="INTEL32::LINUX">
...
</pool>
----

There are various kickstat.* properties, which have sensible default
values. These are documented in the properties section.
