The Site Catalog - sites.xml
----------------------------
The site catalog lists details of each site that Swift can use. The
default file contains one entry for local execution, and a large number
of commented-out example entries for other sites.

By default, the site catalog is stored in etc/sites.xml. This path can
be overridden with the sites.file configuration property, either in
the Swift configuration file or on the command line.

The sites file is formatted as XML. It consists of <pool> elements,
one for each site that Swift will use.


Pool element
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each pool element must have a handle attribute, giving a symbolic
name for the site. This can be any name, but must correspond to entries
for that site in the transformation catalog.

Optionally, the gridlaunch attribute can be used to specify the path
to kickstart on the site.

Each pool must specify a file transfer method, an execution method and
a remote working directory. Optionally, profile settings can
be specified.


File transfer method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Transfer methods are specified with either the <gridftp> element or
the <filesystem> element.

To use gridftp or local filesystem copy, use the <gridftp> element:

----
<gridftp  url="gsiftp://evitable.ci.uchicago.edu" />
----

The url attribute may specify a GridFTP server, using the gsiftp URI
scheme; or it may specify that filesystem copying will be used (which
assumes that the site has access to the same filesystem as the
submitting machine) using the URI local://localhost.

Filesystem access using scp (the SSH copy protocol) can be specified
using the <filesystem> element:

----
<filesystem url="www11.i2u2.org" provider="ssh"/>
----

For additional ssh configuration information, see the ssh execution
provider documentation below.

Filesystem access using CoG coasters can be also be
specified using the <filesystem> element. More detail about
configuring that can be found in the CoG coasters section.

Execution method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Execution methods may be specified either with the <jobmanager> or
<execution> element.

The <jobmanager> element can be used to specify execution through
GRAM2. For example,

----
<jobmanager universe="vanilla" url="evitable.ci.uchicago.edu/jobmanager-fork" major="2" />
----
The universe attribute should always be set to vanilla. The url
attribute should specify the name of the GRAM2 gatekeeper host, and the
name of the jobmanager to use. The major attribute should always be set
to 2.

The <execution> element can be used to specify execution through other
execution providers:

To use GRAM4, specify the gt4 provider. For example:

----
<execution provider="gt4" jobmanager="PBS" url="tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org" />
----

The url attribute should specify the GRAM4 submission site. The
jobmanager attribute should specify which GRAM4 jobmanager will be used.

For local execution, the local provider should be used, like this:

----
<execution provider="local" url="none" />
----

For PBS execution, the pbs provider should be used:

----
<execution provider="pbs" url="none" />
----

The GLOBUS::queue profile key can be used to
specify which PBS queue jobs will be submitted to.

For execution through a local Condor installation, the condor provider
should be used. This provider can run jobs either in the default vanilla
universe, or can use Condor-G to run jobs on remote sites.

When running locally, only the <execution> element needs to be specified:

----
<execution provider="condor" url="none" />
----

When running with Condor-G, it is necessary to specify the Condor grid
universe and the contact string for the remote site. For example:

----
 <execution provider="condor" />
 <profile namespace="globus" key="jobType">grid</profile>
 <profile namespace="globus" key="gridResource">gt2 belhaven-1.renci.org/jobmanager-fork</profile>
----

For execution through SSH, the ssh provider should be used:

----
<execution url="www11.i2u2.org" provider="ssh"/>
----
with configuration made in ~/.ssh/auth.defaults with the string
'www11.i2u2.org' changed to the appropriate host name:

----
www11.i2u2.org.type=key
www11.i2u2.org.username=hategan
www11.i2u2.org.key=/home/mike/.ssh/i2u2portal
www11.i2u2.org.passphrase=XXXX
----

For execution using the CoG Coaster mechanism, the coaster
provider should be used:

----
<execution provider="coaster" url="tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org"
    jobmanager="gt2:gt2:pbs" />
----

More details about configuration of coasters can be found in the section
on coasters.

Work directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The workdirectory element specifies where on the site files can be
stored.

----
<workdirectory>/home/benc</workdirectory>
----

This file must be accessible through the transfer mechanism specified in
the <gridftp> element and also mounted on all worker nodes that will
be used for execution. A shared cluster scratch filesystem is
appropriate for this.

Profiles
~~~~~~~~
Profile keys can be specified using the <profile> element.
For example:

----
<profile namespace="globus" key="queue">fast</profile>
----

The site catalog format is an evolution of the VDS site catalog format
which is documented here
<http://vds.uchicago.edu/vds/doc/userguide/html/H_SiteCatalog.html>.
