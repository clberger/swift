/**
 * Describes a client caching mechanism. Classes implementing this interface
 * would not deal with the actual physical data processing required to move data
 * in and out the cache. Instead they would implement the accounting mechanism
 * needed for caching.
 * 
 * The logical flow of the process is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * 	<li> The client code wants to cache an entry
 * 	<li> The client code calls <code>addAndLockEntry</code> with the respective
 * 		entry. This will lock the entry for both usage and processing. The
 * 		<code>addAndLockEntry</code> method returns a <code>CacheReturn</code>
 * 		object (let's call it <code>status</code>), which can signal a few things:
 * 
 * 		<ol>
 * 			<li> If the entry is already cached, then <code>status.alreadyCached</code>
 * 				will be <code>true</code>, and <code>status.cached</code> will contain
 * 				the cached entry. The client code should check then if the already cached
 * 				entry is locked for processing by calling the
 * 				<code>isLockedForProcessing</code> method, and:
 * 				<ol>
 * 					<li> If the entry is locked for processing, the client code should add a
 * 						listener to the entry in order to get notified when the processing is
 * 						complete (<code>status.cached.addProcessingListener</code>). Upon receipt
 * 						of notification of processing completion, the client code should retry
 * 						calling the addAndLockEntry, since the processing may have involved the
 * 						removal of the file from the cache.
 * 					<li> If the entry is not locked for processing, the client code can assume
 * 						that the entry is correctly present in the physical cache
 * 				</ol>
 * 			<li> If the entry is not cached (<code>status.alreadyCached</code> is <code>false</code>), 
 * 				then the client code must physically put the entry into the cache, after which it 
 * 				shoult call <code>unlockFromProcessing</code>
 * 			<li> Removal requests are listed in the <code>status.remove</code> list. The entries
 * 				returned must be already locked for processing by the cache implementation, in 
 * 				order to prevent them from being used by other threads. 
 * 				The application code should physically remove such entries from the cache, and 
 * 				then call <code>fileRemoved</code>.
 * 		</ol> 
 * 	<li> The client code uses the cached data
 * 	<li> The client code calls <code>unlockEntry</code> to signal that the data is not needed by the
 * 		application any more, and it can eventually be removed from the cache
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Alternatively, the <code>addEntry</code> method can be used to add an entry to the cache without
 * locking it in any way. This is intended for cases when the client code does not have direct control
 * over what goes into the physical cache.
