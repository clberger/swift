This directory contains testcases to test the Swift CDM for the following cases:
case 1. When input data is specified as relative or full path name.
case 2. When the output data is specified as relative or full path name.
case 3. When the config option wrapper.invocation.mode is set to 'absolute' or 'relative'

The above cases lead to 8 possible combinations of input/output data specification and the wrapper.invocation.mode value.

The naming of swift scripts are given based on how the data is specified:

ff=both input and output data is specified as *fullpaths*
rf=input data in relative path and output data in fullpath
fr=input data in full path and output data in relative path
rr=both input and output data in relative path

Two different versions of config files represent the absolute and relative options for wrapper.invocation.mode:
cf.absolute
cf.relative

A run.sh file contains the commandlines to run all the combinations.

You will need to adapt the absolute pathnames in the swift sources based on where you run.

The CDM policy file is fs.data.
