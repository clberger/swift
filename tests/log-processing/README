There are 109 executables in the log-processing libexec directory.

One test for each would be useful.

However, some of these executables are probably unused, in which case
removing them would be a better thing to do.

For the text processing ones, a diff based approach would be good. For
the ones that output graphs or other hard-to-compare data, checking that
a non-trivial output file of some kind is made is probably the best thing
to do.
