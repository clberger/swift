Site tests
==========

To run all tests in the root, say:

 $ ./run-all

To run a single site test, say:

 $ ./run-site <nameofsitefile>

To run a subdirectory of tests, say:

 $ ./run-all subdirectory/

The trailing / is important.

The tests in the root of sites/ should generally work for users associated
with Swift (for example, by being on Swift teragrid allocations or by being
in an OSG VO)

Tests in wonky/ should run locally against a Swift built with provider-wonky.
These generally should test the reliabilty mechanisms of Swift.

Tests defined in subdirectories named after hosts (eg tg-login.uc.teragrid.org)
should be run on that host, and should test functionality available on that
host (such as a local PBS or condor installation).
